This play will only work if ec2_metric_alarm.py is on the devel branch or on version 1.8+

Before running this play, create an awscreds.conf file in roles/common/files or set up your instances with a role. The credentials or tole you use should have the CloudWatch:putmetric permission.
The format for awscreds.conf is:


>AWSAccessKeyId= //enter key ID here  
>AWSSecretKey= //enter secret key here


Run deploy.yaml to only push the metrics, and run create-alarm.yaml to push the metrics and create alarms based on them. create-alarm.yaml is currently configured to create alarms that alert when a disk is beyond 75% full.

The following variables are included and can be overwritten by passing them with -e

>hosts: ec2  
>user: smiller  
>serial: 10  
>max_fail: 20  
>script_dir: /var/local/cloudwatch/  
>iam_role: false  
>topic: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:406822941806:infrastructure_alarms
